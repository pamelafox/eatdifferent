        Hi, I’m Pamela Fox. I’ve always been a little bit chubby, and after being told by my doctor that I’d gotten a bit too chubby (“overweight”), I decided to research obesity and nutrition. I discovered that everything I thought I knew was wrong - for example, fat doesn’t make you fat (excessive carbohydrates do) and exercise doesn’t make you thin (but it can make you stronger). Armed with my new knowledge, I changed my eating habits, lost my extra weight (40 lbs/18 kg), and I feel healthier than I’ve ever been.
        </p>
        <p> 
         I feel like I spent my life completely oblivious to how my body works, and now I want to make sure other people give themselves the opportunity to inform themselves and make the right decisions for their body. This site is just one way I hope to do that.
        </p>

      <section class="content">
        <h2 id="eatthis">Eat This, Not That</h2>
        <p>Want some examples of what I mean? Here are some typical American meals alongside meals that are much healthier alternatives.</p>


        <figure class="bad">
        <h3>Cereal & Milk</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_cereal.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/like_the_grand_canyon/">Like_the_Grand_Canyon</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>Many people start off their day with a breakfast like this, but even the "healthy" cereal isn't great for you. Cereal is made from grains, which makes it high in carbs and anti-nutrients. Milk contains proteins that promote weight gain and hormones that increase acne. 
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="good">
        <h3>Bacon & Eggs</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_baconeggs.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacbt/">gemteck1</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>A better way to start off your day is with bacon and eggs. Bacon can be a delicious source of protein and fat, if made from naturally raised pigs and nitrate free, and eggs are a source of good cholesterol and protein.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="bad">
        <h3>Tuna Sandwich</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_tunasandwich.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/galant/">thebittenword.com</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>Sandwiches are the go-to lunch for many now, as evidenced by the growing number of sandwich shops. 
        The fillings - the meat and veggies - are good for you, but their nutrition is dwarfed by the not-good-for-you slabs of bread surrounding them. All bread is high in carbs, and multi-grain bread is higher in anti-nutrients like gluten and phytates.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="good">
        <h3>Tuna Salad</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_tunasalad.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lara604/">Lara604</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>A better lunch is just the fillings, but a whole lot more of them. For example, you can enjoy a tuna salad made from homemade mayonnaise (or any not made from bad oils like soybean and canola), veggies, and lettuce.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>      

        <figure class="bad">
        <h3>Burger & Fries</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_burger.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/burgeraustin/">BurgerAustin</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>Ah, the All-American meal...Unfortunately, the burger bun adds excessive carbs to the meal, and ketchup is too high in sugar. Potatoes are okay in moderation, but given their high starch content, they shouldn’t be eaten in such large quantities.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="good">
        <h3>Steak & Asparagus</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_steak.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarsh/">kevinmarsh</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>A more classic American meal: steak & veggies. Steak can be a great source of protein, fat, and vitamins (like vitamin C!), particularly if it’s grass-fed and locally sourced. Green vegetables fried in a healthy fat (like coconut oil or butter) make for a delicious and healthy accompaniment.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>     

        <figure class="bad">
        <h3>Fruit Juice</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_fruitjuice.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/">quinn.anya</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>Fruit juice is often touted as highly nutritonal - it's better than soda, but still - it's not great. Fruits are great sources of nutrients, but they are also high in fructose, a type of sugar. In their natural form, the fructose is wrapped up in the fruit’s fiber and our body takes longer to process it. When they’re juiced, the fructose isn’t wrapped up in anything and the sugar goes straight to the bloodstream. :(
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="good">
        <h3>Iced Tea</h3>
        <img src="img/meal_icedtea.jpg">
        <figcaption class="byline">
          Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mynameisharsha/">mynameisharsha</a>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>A better drink to accompany your meal is tea or iced tea, especially caffeine-free varieties. Tea is high in nutritional benefits with its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and unsweetened iced tea can be a great way to enjoy those benefits on a warm day.
        </figcaption>

        <h2 id="readmore">Read More</h2>
        <p>That’s just a taster of what I learnt. Want to learn more?</p>

        <p>For the short version, I recommend reading <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/03/04/how-to-lose-weight-without-doing-one-minute-of-exercise/">"How to lose weight without doing any exercise"</a> or <a href="http://www.gnolls.org/1141/eat-like-a-predator-not-like-prey-paleo-in-six-easy-steps-a-motivational-guide/">"Eat like a predator, not like prey"</a>.
        </p>

        <p>For the long version, I recommend these books:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li style="clear:right" id="why-we-get-fat"> 
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WUYOQ6?tag=amazonsimilar-20">
          <img class="thumbnail" src="img/cover_whywegetfat.png"></a> 
          <span class="title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WUYOQ6?tag=amazonsimilar-20">Why We Get Fat</a></span> 
           <br>Gary Taubes
           <p>This book disputes nutrition myths that have been propagated for the last 50 years, and explains how fat is formed in the body and how one can lose weight accordingly. It's based on the research he did for his much longer book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?tag=amazonsimilar-20">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a>. If you have the time - read that too!</p> 
        
          <li style="clear:right" id="the-primal-blueprint"> 
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207700?tag=amazonsimilar-20">
          <img class="thumbnail" src="img/cover_primalblueprint.png"></a> 
          <span class="title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207700?tag=amazonsimilar-20">The Primal Blueprint</a></span> 
           <br>Mark Sisson
           <p>A description of Mark's philosophy of living like our ancestors lived 10,000 years ago, focusing on the way they ate, but also on getting good sleep, good play, moving slowly alot, sprinting, and lifting heavy things. A great book about getting back to our roots in all parts of life.</p> 

          <li style="clear:right" id="fast-food-nation"> 
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838582?tag=amazonsimilar-20">

           <br>Eric Schlosser
           <p> A highly informative book about the effect of modern industrialized agriculture on our food, our society, and our environment.</p> 
          
          <li style="clear:right" id="in-defense-of-food">

          <span class="title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964?tag=amazonsimilar-20">In Defense of Food</a></span> 
          <br>Michael Pollan
          <p> A great read about Michael's opinion on how we should be eating today, and a look at why we are eating so badly. It will make you want to run out and eat some organic leafy vegetables immediately.</p>

          Corn is not a vegetable - it's a grain with little nutritional value. Unfortunately, it's now the #1 ingredient in American processed food, in the form of high fructose corn syrup (sweeter than sugar!) and corn oil (not a good type of fat). It's fine to enjoy the occasional corn on the cob at a BBQ, but steer away from making it the #1 ingredient in your life. Check the labels!

          Most people know soda isn't great for you -- but do they know how bad it is? The average can of soda has 39g of sugar, and those grams of sugar go straight to your bloodstream, causing blood sugar spikes and eventually insulin resistance and chronic diseases like diabetes. Instead of drinking soda with your meals, enjoy a glass of water with a lemon wedge or some unsweetened iced tea.

          <p>Flour is ground up grains (like wheat) and is the main ingredient in breads, cakes, and pastries.

Never fear - you can use almond flour or coconut flour as more nutritional substitutes.

Bread is a source of excessive carbohydrates as well as filled with anti-nutrients (like gluten and phytates). Our recommendation? Order your meals without the bread.
